Password protecion means that there is a key to unlock something.
If someone gets the key it can open your something

Password encryption alters data

usually encription is also known as asymmetric encription

It generates basically a pair of keys: one public and one private
You can generate them with your pc.

Generally the public one can be distributed wherever you want and given to whoever.
If someone gets the key will only be able to encrytpt things with this.
Therefore this key provide also a "map" (a sort of list of instructions)
to encrypt whatever thing.

If someone gets this key it will not be able to open anything.
The possible message or whatever will be a meaningless list of symbols.

Only the owner of the private key will be able to unencrypt it.

-----------------------

Example with signal:


user a sends a message to user b

They will exchange first their public keys
in order to exchange messages keeping for
themselves their private key (that will unencrypt the message)
So user A will have the instructions
to encrypt messages for user b and
user b will have the instructions
to encrypt messages for user a

User A can send a message encripting it with the 'instructions'
contained in the public key that has received by the User
B.
(User B can spread its public key)

In this way they will send messages encrypted.
If a man appears in the middle an intercepts the
message he will not be able to read it.

It will see something like: 80°ç*ç!££$"%/?^^!EWRG!£!Edstg2"

Only the receiver will be able to do that with his private keys.
the receiver will unencrypt the message with his private key


Protocols that use asymmetric key algoritm

GPG, PGP, IPSec, SSH, Bitcoin
