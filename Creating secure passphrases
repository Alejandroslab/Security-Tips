you will need
rolldice package in Debian from another machine possibly

procedure:

generate a sequence of 5 random numbers with dices

with the command

rolldice 5x

search the corresponding term in the wordlist (could be diceware)

take note of the word

repeat the procedure other 5 times to get a 6 words passphrase

usually the entropy of these passhprase are very high
(>130 bits) therefore they are very secure passwords
