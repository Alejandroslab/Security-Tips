Entropy is calculated in bits

Entropy = log2(Number of Possible Combinations)
this will be bits as unit of measure

where

Number of Possible Combinations = S^L

where

L = Password Length; Number of symbols in the password (your lenght)

S = Size of the pool of unique possible symbols (character set).

those could be:

Numbers (0-9): 10
Lower Case Latin Alphabet (a-z): 26
Lower Case & Upper Case Latin Alphabet (a-z, A-Z): 52
ASCII Printable Character Set (a-z, A-Z, symbols, space): 95


Example

password: 123456

Number of possible combinations
Assuming only number the S, size of the pool will be 10
the L, password lenght will be 6

Number of Possible Combinations = 1 000 0000
Entropy =log2(1000000) = 19.93 bits

this password will be therefore weak.

Password strength is determined with this chart, which might be a bit of a stretch for a non-critical password:

    < 28 bits = Very Weak; might keep out family members
    28 - 35 bits = Weak; should keep out most people, often good for desktop login passwords
    36 - 59 bits = Reasonable; fairly secure passwords for network and company passwords
    60 - 127 bits = Strong; can be good for guarding financial information
    128+ bits = Very Strong; often overkill
